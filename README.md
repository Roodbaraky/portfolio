# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using TypeScript, React + NextJS and TailwindCSS for responsivity and mobile-friendly design.

The main aim of this site is to showcase some skills and help recruiters/hiring managers make the *right* decision ;)


## Technologies used:

- TypeScript
- React.js
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS


## Features

- Responsive Design: *Should* be really responsive and multi-device friendly.
- Dark/Light/Kawaii Mode: Toggle between themes to match your preference -like most things I build, it looks better in the dark :) 
- Interactive UI: Smooth transitions, animations, behaviours
  - auto-hide navbar using useState / useContext from React.js
  - dynamic resizing / layout via TailwindCSS
- Tactile Elements: For lack of a better term...
  - contact form - I will *eventually* replace the form hosting with my own back-end to handle messages
  - hover / click nav menus

## To-Do

There's *always* something to do. I have a lot in mind for this project, but it's important for me to stop being a perfectionist and deploy at this time.
With that said, here's some things I'd like to accomplish for this site in the near future:

- AI-powered cover letter generator
- back-end for handling contact form -no more external hosting!


Please do get in touch if you have suggestions to further improve on this!
